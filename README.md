# gauss_seidel_power_flow.m
• PowerWorld does use the Newton Raphson method instead of the Gauss Seidel but
the result should be the same. Of course this can have an effect on the convergence
speed and computation time which should be discussed in the comparison section
• Only PowerWorld has to be used in the System improvements section.
• If you believe your results are incorrect you need to provide evidence on what you
have tried to fix it and what you think the reason for the wrong results is. This allows
for partial marks to be awarded.
• For the improvement section (and only this ) please assume the following:
o The generator on bus 5 has a maximum MVAr rating of 80 MVAr.
o The line between Bus 1 and Bus 2 is out of commission
